"Our flagship product, the Firefox Web browser, is and will continue to be a "

"Firefox OS is the first truly open operating system for mobile devices, "

"technologies and APIs to make the Web a rich and viable platform for the "
"mobile industry. With the support of valued partners from across the mobile "
"ecosystem, Firefox OS phones are now on sale in 10 markets globally (as of "
"mid-November 2013), and Mozilla will continue to advance its development and "

"building a better Internet. When we see growth in community contributors, "
"software localizations, and a competitive browser market, for example, we "
