#: firefox/dnt.lang:42
msgid ""
"Do Not Track is a step toward putting you in control of the way your "
"information is collected and used online. Do Not Track is a feature in "
"Firefox that allows you to let a website know you would like to opt-out of "
"third-party tracking for purposes including behavioral advertising. It does "
"this by transmitting a Do Not Track HTTP header every time your data is "
"requested from the Web."

"your privacy preferences, you will see more generic ads in place of "
"behavioral ads."
