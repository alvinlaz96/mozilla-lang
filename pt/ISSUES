Wolof:
	'quote' need to enable proper French quoting
	Need to make it clearer that you can mark something as a false positive
	Need to make it clear qhy this might be a fault
	Need some way to mark things as not accronyms
	Need some way to mark quotes as decorative as apposed to programming.
	Need to solve issue of numbers at the start meaning that we want lowercase.
		e.g. 360 degrees -> Degrees 360 -> fixed to -> degrees 360
	Really need substring matching where we have expressions and words translated
		elsewhere e.g. Personas, Plugin Check

General:
	Seeing the need again to combine strings
	Is there anyway we could hide the XML markings to allow someone to translate
		with them hidden.  Or toggle: full, placeholder, hidden.
		Also toggle for <b>, <i>, etc placeing the text in bold, italic.

Notes:
	Amagama - daily updates
	Move to UOSLOUÂ§

Others:
	Abstract way to do multfile type errors
		Current we do:
			Errors type -> unit with error
		We need to also do
			Error type -> error -> units with this error
